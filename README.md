# RegExtractor
<b>Java regular expression visualization.</b><br> 
Provides a tolls to create and analyze a regular expression, its matching, structure, split effects, and capturing groups information. 
The analysis is based on color highlighting of matching of particular regular expression constructs withing given pattern. 
However, as regular expressions are quite complex topic, its could show wrong results when confronted with more complicated
patterns, especially with nested quantifiers, lookahead and lookbehind constructs.

<i>One of my best learning experiences. The project serves as introduction to regular expression topic, and what I had learned 
during coding, exceeded my expectations. I couldn't imagine better way to learn and understand how regex works, especially when
connected with lecture of <b>Mastering Regular Expression</b> by <b>Jeffrey Friedl</b>. Personally, I would recommend such
project for everyone who would like to learn regular expressions.
